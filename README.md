**AI Waiting Room** is a Chrome extension that keeps you entertained while you wait for long AI generations on Google AI Studio. It automatically switches your focus to entertainment content (YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, or TikTok) when you hit generate, and switches back immediately when the AI finishes.
